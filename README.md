By Esteban Ariza, Mateo Valdes & Johan Sebastián Giraldo

**Step 1**: Go to <https://github.com/Esarac/Finite-State-Machine-Reduction>[ ](https://github.com/Esarac/Finite-State-Machine-Reduction)and click on “Download

ZIP”

**Step 2**: Extract the ZIP file and open the folder called “Finite-State Machine”

**Step 3**: Click on the index.html file.





**Step 4**: Your web browser should open with the following page:

Here is an explanation:

\1.

State #: The number of states in the finite state machine

\2. Alphabet #: The number of elements in the finite-state machine’s input alphabet

\3. Type of machine: The finite-state machine can be either a Mealy machine or a Moore machine.

•

•

The Moore machine’s output is determined by its current state.

The Mealy machine’s output is determined by both its current state and current input.

\4. Create table: Once you enter all the information, click this button to create the table!





Moore machine:

If you are creating a Moore machine, you should see something like this:

Here is an explanation:

•

•

The states: These are the states of the machine (q0 is the initial state)

The transition: Each column represents an input, and each cell represents the state where

the machine will go given that particular input. Must be a non-negative integer (0

represents q0, 1 represents q1, 2 represents q2, etc.)

•

•

The output: The output associated with the current state

Once you have entered all the data, click this button to reduce the Moore machine

Example:





Mealy machine:

If you are creating a Moore machine, you should see something like this:

Here is an explanation:





•

•

The states: These are the states of the machine (q0 is the initial state)

The transition and output: Each column is divided into two. The left part represents the

state where the machine will go given that particular input. The right part represents the

output given the current state and current input.
